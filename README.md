Overview
This project creates a clean, responsive landing page using HTML and CSS. It includes a header with a logo and navigation, a hero section with a heading, paragraph, and call-to-action button, and a footer with social media links. CSS Flexbox ensures a flexible layout, and media queries handle responsiveness for smaller screens.
